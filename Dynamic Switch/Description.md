This is the first cypher I've made, and it's a pretty tough one. This is a relatively simple cypher which I thought of while sitting on the toilet. It requires virtually no computing power to decode, so it can be encoded and decoded with just a calculator and very good memory. I believe the concept is novel, though it is clearly based off of one of the most famous (and easy) ciphers. It's Shannon entropy is calculated to be around 4.8. It uses two numbers, both of which are found in nature and are common constants in physics. This is an incredibly softened version of a (hopefully) unbreakable cypher I am cooking up (at the time of writing) called Pandora's Switch. Good luck.
